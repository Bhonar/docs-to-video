## What Is This Project?

**Docs-to-Tutorial** turns any documentation URL into a polished MP4 tutorial video — using the user's **own React components** so the video matches their actual product's look and feel.

It's built as an **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** + **Claude Code Skill** + **Remotion template**. When a user types `/docs-to-tutorial https://docs.example.com/quickstart` in Claude Code, Claude orchestrates a 6-step pipeline: scan the codebase → scaffold a Remotion project → extract the docs → generate audio → design & write scenes → render to MP4.

### Why It Lives Inside the User's Project

The `remotion/` folder imports the user's components with relative paths (`../../../src/components/ui/button`). The Tailwind config scans `../src/**/*.{ts,tsx}` to pick up their classes. This only works if `remotion/` is a sibling of the user's `src/`.

---

## Data Flow: URL → MP4

```
/docs-to-tutorial https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart
  │
  ▼
Step 1: Claude scans the user's codebase
  → Finds components, import paths, Tailwind config, project root
  │
  ▼
Step 2: Scaffold remotion/ (if needed)
  → Copies remotion-template/ into user's project
  → Updates tailwind.config.js content paths for user's component dirs
  → npm install
  │
  ▼
Step 3: MCP Tool → extract_docs_content
  → Tabstack API: markdown + JSON metadata
  → Playwright: logo, screenshot colors, CSS variables
  → Saves: logo to remotion/public/images/
  → Returns: { markdown, metadata, branding, domain, warnings }
  │
  ▼
Step 4: Claude writes narration script, then MCP Tool → generate_audio
  → ElevenLabs TTS: narration MP3 (free tier)
  → ElevenLabs Music: background music MP3 (paid plan, optional)
  → Beat detection: aubio → ffmpeg → heuristic fallback
  → Saves: audio to remotion/public/audio/
  → Returns: { music, narration, beats, warnings }
  │
  ▼
Step 5: Claude designs scenes & writes Generated.tsx
  → Imports user's components with relative paths
  → Uses Remotion animation APIs (spring, interpolate, TransitionSeries)
  → Mounts <Audio> with staticFile() paths to saved MP3s
  → Includes: StepIndicator, TypingText, HighlightedCode, CalloutCard, staged reveals
  │
  ▼
Step 6: MCP Tool → render_video
  → bundle() with Tailwind webpack override
  → selectComposition() triggers calculateMetadata
    → Reads actual narration duration → sets durationInFrames
  → renderMedia() → h264 MP4
  → Saves: ~/Videos/docs-to-tutorial/<name>.mp4
```

## Key Technical Decisions

### Narration Drives Video Duration
`calculateMetadata` in `Root.tsx` reads the actual narration MP3 duration at render time. Claude's `duration` estimate only affects music length. This means the video is always exactly as long as the narration — no awkward silence or truncation.

Priority: narration duration → music duration → props.duration → 30s fallback.

### `remotionProjectPath` on Every Tool
All 4 MCP tools accept an optional `remotionProjectPath` parameter. Without it, they fall back to `process.cwd()/remotion`, but `cwd` depends on how Claude Code spawns the server — so the explicit parameter is the reliable option. The SKILL.md instructs Claude to always pass it.

Resolution priority: explicit arg → `REMOTION_PROJECT_PATH` env → `{cwd}/remotion`.

### `staticPath` vs `localPath`
- `localPath`: absolute filesystem path (e.g., `/Users/me/my-app/remotion/public/audio/narration-123.mp3`)
- `staticPath`: relative to `remotion/public/` (e.g., `audio/narration-123.mp3`)

Only `staticPath` is used inside `Generated.tsx` via `staticFile()`. This is a Remotion requirement.

### Graceful Degradation Everywhere
Every extraction step has 2-3 fallbacks. Nothing throws an unrecoverable error:
- Tabstack fails → Playwright DOM walking → placeholder content
- Logo: Clearbit → common paths → Google favicon
- Music fails (paid plan required) → narration-only video
- Beat detection: aubio → ffmpeg silencedetect → 120 BPM heuristic
- Colors: CSS variables → button backgrounds → screenshot analysis → hardcoded `#0066FF`

All degradation is reported in the `warnings` array so Claude can adapt.

### Single Playwright Session Per Tool
Both `extract-docs.ts` and `extract-url.ts` consolidate screenshot capture + CSS extraction into a single browser launch to reduce latency.

### Tailwind in Remotion
The `webpackOverride: enableTailwind` in `render-video.ts` is **critical** — without it, Tailwind classes in both the template and the user's imported components would be ignored during rendering. The template includes `style.css` with `@tailwind` directives and a `tailwind.config.js` that scans the parent project.

## File-by-File Reference

### MCP Server (`mcp-server/src/`)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `server.ts` | MCP entry point. Stdio transport. Registers 4 tools, routes tool calls. Loads `.env` relative to its own location (not cwd). |
| `tools/extract-docs.ts` | Docs URL → markdown + metadata + branding. Tabstack markdown + JSON endpoints, Playwright fallback, CSS color extraction. |
| `tools/extract-url.ts` | Marketing URL → content + branding + screenshots. Tabstack JSON, Playwright single-session extraction. Validates Tabstack response structure. |
| `tools/generate-audio.ts` | Narration + music → MP3 files + beat timestamps. ElevenLabs TTS (free) + Music (paid). Saves to `remotion/public/audio/`. |
| `tools/render-video.ts` | Bundles + renders Remotion composition → MP4. Applies Tailwind webpack override. Output to `~/Videos/docs-to-tutorial/`. |
| `utils/paths.ts` | Single source of truth for `remotion/`, `public/`, `audio/`, `images/`, and output directories. All tools import from here. |
| `utils/branding.ts` | Logo extraction (Clearbit → common paths → favicon), `downloadLogoToPublic()`, `rgbaToHex()` (handles hex/rgb/rgba/hsl/hsla/named colors), `darkenHex()`, `detectTheme()`, `inferIndustry()`. |
| `utils/beat-detection.ts` | `detectBeats()`: aubio → ffmpeg silencedetect → 120 BPM heuristic. Accepts `duration` param for heuristic fallback. |
| `utils/color-extraction.ts` | `extractColorsFromScreenshot()`: sharp dominant color → 4-color palette (primary/secondary/accent/background). |
| `utils/screenshot.ts` | `takeScreenshot()`: Playwright headless, `domcontentloaded` (not `networkidle` — avoids SPA hangs), viewport-only (not fullPage). |

### Remotion Template (`remotion-template/`)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/Root.tsx` | Composition registration. Defines `TutorialVideoProps` type contract. `calculateMetadata` determines video duration from narration audio. |
| `src/index.ts` | Remotion entry. `registerRoot(Root)`, imports `style.css` for Tailwind. |
| `src/style.css` | Tailwind CSS directives (`@tailwind base/components/utilities`). Required for Tailwind processing. |
| `src/compositions/Generated.tsx` | Placeholder composition. **Overwritten by Claude for every video.** Has working default with font loading, audio, and animation. |
| `package.json` | Remotion 4.0.421 + React 18 + Tailwind 3.4 dependencies. |
| `tsconfig.json` | `jsx: "react-jsx"` (automatic JSX transform), `moduleResolution: "bundler"`. |
| `tailwind.config.js` | Content paths: `./src/**` + `../src/**` (user's project). No keyframes/animations (Remotion forbids them). |

### Skill & Config

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `skill/SKILL.md` | The 6-step workflow Claude follows. Describes what each step does, what tool to call, what params to pass, and what to do with the results. Includes complete Generated.tsx example with reusable components. |
| `README.md` | User-facing setup guide. Step-by-step from clone to first video. |
| `.env.example` | Template for API keys: `TABSTACK_API_KEY`, `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`, optional `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID`. |

### Tests (`mcp-server/src/__tests__/`)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `utils/__tests__/branding.test.ts` | 19 tests for `rgbaToHex`, `darkenHex`, `detectTheme`, `inferIndustry`. Covers hex, rgb, rgba, hsl, hsla, named colors, edge cases. |
| `utils/__tests__/paths.test.ts` | 9 tests for all path resolution functions. Tests explicit/env/fallback priority chain. |
| `__tests__/server-smoke.test.ts` | Spawns the real compiled MCP server, sends JSON-RPC `initialize` + `tools/list`, verifies 4 tools with `remotionProjectPath` on all of them. |
| `__tests__/integration.test.ts` | Live API tests (auto-skipped without keys). Tests `extract_docs_content` against Stripe docs, `extract_url_content` against remotion.dev, `generate_audio` with a short narration script. |

## External APIs

| API | What We Use It For | Auth | Free Tier |
|-----|-------------------|------|-----------|
| **Tabstack** (`api.tabstack.ai`) | `/v1/extract/markdown` for page content, `/v1/extract/json` for structured metadata | Bearer token | 50k credits/month |
| **ElevenLabs** (`api.elevenlabs.io`) | `/v1/text-to-speech/{voiceId}` for narration, `/v1/music` for background music | `xi-api-key` header | TTS: yes. Music: no (paid plan). |
| **Clearbit** (`logo.clearbit.com`) | High-quality logo images by domain | None (free) | Unlimited |
| **Google Favicon** (`google.com/s2/favicons`) | Fallback logo (256px favicon) | None (free) | Unlimited |

### ElevenLabs Specifics
- `output_format` is a **query parameter**, not a body parameter: `POST /v1/music?output_format=mp3_44100_128`
- Default voice: `jsCqWAovK2LkecY7zXl4` (Freya — expressive young woman, good for tutorials)
- Model: `eleven_multilingual_v2` for TTS, `music_v1` for music
- Responses are raw binary audio (`responseType: 'arraybuffer'`)

### Tabstack Specifics
- Markdown endpoint returns `{ content: "..." }` (NOT `{ markdown: "..." }`)
- JSON endpoint accepts a `json_schema` object defining the extraction shape
- Priced per request, not per token

## What We Fixed (Changelog from Development)

### Round 1 — Showstoppers

| Issue | What Was Wrong | Fix |
|-------|---------------|-----|
| Path chaos | 3 different hardcoded paths across files (`__dirname/../../../remotion-project`, `__dirname/../../../../remotion-project`, `process.cwd()/remotion`) | Created `src/utils/paths.ts` with single `getRemotionProjectPath()`. All tools import from it. |
| FFmpeg beat detection never worked | `2>&1` redirected stderr to stdout, but code read from `{ stderr }` which was empty | Removed `2>&1`. FFmpeg silencedetect output stays in stderr where the code reads it. |
| Heuristic beats hardcoded 60s | `detectBeats()` always generated beats for 60 seconds | Added `duration` parameter, passed from `generateAudio()`. |
| ElevenLabs `output_format` | Was in request body | Moved to query parameter: `POST /v1/music?output_format=mp3_44100_128`. |
| Duplicate H1 in Playwright markdown | H1 extracted separately AND encountered during DOM traversal | Removed separate H1 extraction. `processNode` handles it once. |
| Template missing files | No `src/index.ts`, no `src/style.css`, `Generated.tsx` was barebones | Created all three with proper content. |
| Duration priority wrong | Music duration took priority over narration | Changed to narration-first in `calculateMetadata`. |
| MiniMax TTS code | Unused, user chose ElevenLabs only | Removed all MiniMax code entirely. |
| Brandfetch API | Required API key that was never configured, always 401 | Removed. Logo extraction uses Clearbit → common paths → Google favicon. |

### Round 2 — Reliability

| Issue | What Was Wrong | Fix |
|-------|---------------|-----|
| **SKILL.md workflow ordering** | Steps 2-3 saved audio/images to `remotion/public/` BEFORE Step 4 scaffolded `remotion/`. A `cp -r` would overwrite those files. | Moved scaffold to Step 2 (before extraction). |
| `process.cwd()` unreliable | Only `render_video` accepted explicit path. Other tools relied on `cwd` blindly. | Added `remotionProjectPath` parameter to all 4 tools, threaded through all internal functions. |
| Missing `tsconfig.json` | Remotion template had no TypeScript config. JSX transform could fail. | Created with `jsx: "react-jsx"`, `moduleResolution: "bundler"`. |
| `rgbaToHex` limited | Only handled `rgb()` and `rgba()`. Failed on `hsl()`, `oklch()`, named colors. | Rewrote to handle hex (incl. shorthand), rgb/rgba, hsl/hsla, 30+ named CSS colors. |
| Tailwind content paths | Hardcoded `../src/**/*.{ts,tsx}`. Fails for `app/`, monorepo structures. | SKILL.md Step 2 now instructs Claude to inspect and update content paths. |
| Tabstack response not validated | `extract-url.ts` returned `response.data` directly | Added type checking and field normalization with safe defaults. |
| 2+ Playwright sessions in extract-docs | Separate browser launches for screenshot and CSS colors | Combined into single `extractBrandingWithCssColors()` function. |
| `extractColorsFromImage` stub | Always returned hardcoded `#0066FF` | Removed the stub function entirely. Only `extractColorsFromScreenshot` (which uses sharp) remains. |
| `networkidle` hangs | `screenshot.ts` used `networkidle` which hangs on SPAs with WebSockets | Changed to `domcontentloaded` + 2s wait. Also `fullPage: false` to avoid huge screenshots. |
| Empty `public/` dirs lost by git | `public/audio/` and `public/images/` were empty, wouldn't survive clone | Added `.gitkeep` files. |

## How to Run Tests

```bash
cd docs-to-tutorial/mcp-server

# Unit tests (no API keys needed, fast)
npm test

# Run a specific test file
npx vitest run src/utils/__tests__/branding.test.ts

# Integration tests (needs API keys)
TABSTACK_API_KEY=xxx ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=xxx npx vitest run src/__tests__/integration.test.ts

# Build (always run after code changes)
npm run build
```

**Test coverage (29 passing tests):**
- `branding.test.ts` — 19 tests: `rgbaToHex` (9 cases), `darkenHex` (4), `detectTheme` (3), `inferIndustry` (3)
- `paths.test.ts` — 9 tests: all 5 path functions with priority chain validation
- `server-smoke.test.ts` — 1 test: MCP server startup + tools/list verification

---

## How to Test End-to-End

1. Have a React project with components (buttons, cards, etc.)
2. Clone this repo inside that project
3. Follow README setup (build MCP server, add API keys, register with Claude Code)
4. Run: `/docs-to-tutorial https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart`
5. Check: `~/Videos/docs-to-tutorial/` for the output MP4

---

## Known Limitations (Pre-Release)

1. **Narration timecodes are estimated** — The `timecodes` array in `generateAudio` uses a ~150 wpm heuristic, not actual audio timing. Scene-to-speech sync may drift on longer videos. A proper fix would use ElevenLabs' word-level timestamps API.

2. **oklch/lab/lch colors fall back to `#0066FF`** — Modern CSS color functions can't be converted to hex without a full CSS engine. These formats are becoming more common in modern design systems.

3. **No hot reload in development** — After code changes, you must `npm run build` before testing via Claude Code. The `npm run dev` script uses `tsx watch` but only for the server entry point, not for MCP integration testing.

4. **`extractColorsFromScreenshot` is basic** — Uses sharp's single dominant color. A production implementation would use k-means clustering for a proper 4-color palette extraction.

5. **Narration voice is configurable** — Defaults to Freya (expressive young woman). Override with `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID` env var for a different voice.

6. **No video preview before render** — The user can run `cd remotion && npm run dev` to preview in Remotion Studio, but the SKILL.md workflow goes straight to render. Could add a preview step.

7. **`tailwind.config.js` content paths need manual adjustment** — SKILL.md tells Claude to update them, but if Claude misses a component directory, those classes get purged in the rendered video.

---

## Development Workflow

```bash
# 1. Make code changes in mcp-server/src/
# 2. Build
cd docs-to-tutorial/mcp-server && npm run build

# 3. Run unit tests
npm test

# 4. Test via Claude Code (restart Claude Code after build)
claude
> /docs-to-tutorial https://some-docs-url.com

# 5. Check output
ls ~/Videos/docs-to-tutorial/
```

When modifying tool interfaces (adding params, changing return types):
1. Update the tool function signature in `tools/*.ts`
2. Update the schema in `server.ts` (both `ListToolsRequestSchema` and `CallToolRequestSchema` handlers)
3. Update `SKILL.md` to tell Claude about the new parameter
4. Update tests in `__tests__/`
5. Rebuild: `npm run build`
